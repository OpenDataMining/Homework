Please include \r\n\t\texamples (including how to access), but it is not necessary to copy a full set of data.\r\n\r\n<b>Algorithms</b> -- \tcan be as simple as linking to a Wikipedia article, for a request to have someone in the \r\n\t\tgroup investigate further (and update the file), to providing intimate details of an \r\n\t\talgorithm.\r\n\r\n<b>ProjectIdeas</b> -- a place for thoughts on something interesting to do or investigate / topic areas for \r\n\t\tpresentations / or full project specifications. They can be totally novel or implementations \r\n\t\tand/or adaptations of public works, academic papers, and anything in-between.  \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFeel free to request assistance via contacting @yingli, @bhaumik or @kennyh\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
